# Connect-n-Game

The game is very similar to the classic connect-4 game, except the user gets to determine the board dimensions, and number of pieces needed to win. To run, download the files included and type "make" in the compiler in order to compile the files. After that, you may run the game by typing "./connectn.out" + the number of rows + the number of columns + the number of pieces in a row needed to win. Ex: "./connectn.out 6 5 3".
